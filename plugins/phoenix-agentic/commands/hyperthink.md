# /hyperthink

Activate Steve Jobs-inspired deep thinking methodology for revolutionary problem-solving.

## Usage

```
/hyperthink [topic]
```

## Thinking Depth Hierarchy

```
hyperthink (64K) > ultrathink (32K) > think harder (16K) > think (8K)
```

**hyperthink** is the deepest level of thinking - used for:
- Revolutionary product decisions
- Fundamental architecture choices
- User experience breakthroughs
- Problems that seem impossible
- When "good enough" is not enough

## Visual Identity

**Electric Blue Pulse** - Pulsating electric blue (`#00d4ff` → `#00ffff`) representing revolutionary thinking and electrical synaptic firing of transformative ideas.

## The Five Phases

### Phase 1: Revolutionary Vision (30 seconds)
```
STOP. BREATHE. ASK:
- What impossible thing could become possible here?
- Who is the human on the other side of this code?
- What would make them say "wow, someone actually understood me"?
```

### Phase 2: First Principles Deconstruction (60 seconds)
```
DECONSTRUCT:
- What are we REALLY trying to achieve? (Not the task, the outcome)
- What constraints are actually real vs. inherited assumptions?
- What would a 10x better solution look like?
```

### Phase 3: Craftsman's Plan (90 seconds)
```
PLAN:
- Sketch the user's emotional journey
- Identify the "moment of magic" - when they feel understood
- Work backward from delight to implementation
- Find the elegant path - the one that feels inevitable
```

### Phase 4: Execute with Obsession
```
BUILD:
- Every line intentional
- Every name meaningful
- Every abstraction earned
- Every error message a moment of empathy
```

### Phase 5: Polish Until It Shines
```
REFINE:
- Read it like poetry - does it flow?
- Test it like a skeptic - where does it break?
- Use it like a novice - where does it confuse?
- Ship it like Jobs - would he be proud?
```

## The Six Principles

1. **Think Different** - There is no box. Question everything.
2. **Obsess Over Details** - Every pixel matters. Every millisecond counts.
3. **Plan Like Da Vinci** - Sketch the user's emotional journey before coding.
4. **Craft, Don't Code** - You're crafting an experience, not writing code.
5. **Iterate Relentlessly** - Ship, then improve. But never ship garbage.
6. **Simplify Ruthlessly** - If it doesn't serve the user's moment of truth, kill it.

## The Hyperthink Mantra

```
We're not here to ship features.
We're here to change lives.
Every keystroke is a brushstroke.
Every function is a philosophy.
This isn't just code.
This is how we dent the universe.
```
