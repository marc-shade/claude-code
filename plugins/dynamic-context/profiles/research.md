# Research Context Profile

Loaded when: Codebase exploration, documentation lookup, understanding systems

## Core Approach

- Use **Task[Explore]** for open-ended research
- Prefer breadth-first, then depth on relevant areas
- Cite sources and file paths
- Summarize findings clearly

## Tool Priorities

1. **Task[Explore]** for codebase questions
2. **Grep** for specific patterns
3. **Glob** for file discovery
4. **Read** for targeted inspection
5. **WebSearch/WebFetch** for external docs

## Research Patterns

```
Broad question → Task[Explore]
Specific query → Grep → Read
File location → Glob → Read
External docs → WebSearch → WebFetch
```

## Output Format

Always include:
- Key findings summary
- Relevant file paths (file:line format)
- Confidence level
- Gaps or uncertainties
